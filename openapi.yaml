  description: |
    This microservice allows access to the consumer database. The consumers listed in the database have the following 
    attributes:
    - Name
    - Location
    - UUID
    
    The consumer management service is one of the core services of the WISdoM system and is automatically included with
    every standard installation.
    
    **IMPORTANT NOTICE**  
    This service requires, that the user accessing it was previously authorized via the authorization service and has
    the correct scope for accessing this service. The definition of the scope is stored in the scope description file
    as long as there is no manual replacement done. The scope description file is stored in the folder `res` in the root
    of the repository

        This endpoint allows you to access a list of all consumers listed in the database. To filter your results you
        may use the `usage_above`, `in` and `id` query parameters which will be documented here.
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: usage_above

            The minimal water usage in cubic meters (`mÂ³`) a consumer has ever recorded.
            
            _Please note that the query will take much longer since the database needs to check the usage data._

            One or more consumer UUIDs to select them directly to pull the available information about them. If none of

        This endpoint allows you to create a new consumer in the database.
        
        **Important Notice**
        
        The database is set up with a unique constraint. You may not insert two consumers with the same name in the same
        location.

        **Important Notice**
        To exclude a field from the update, you need to set the value to `null`. However it is not possible to update only one
        coordinate of the location. If you want to update the location, you need to provide both coordinates.

      description: |
        When deleting a consumer from the database, the associated usages are **_not_** removed from the database since
        the usage data may still be important for forecasts or other services.
        
        _If a invalid consumer ID is set in the request the service will still respond with the same response. This 
        behavior is intended as a protection against brute-forcing a consumer UUID for deletion_
